# Fitness Online Frontend - Angular 17

Welcome to the frontend of the **Fitness Online Platform**, built with **Angular 17** - because why not use the latest and greatest? This app is all about making fitness (and code) simple, smooth, and flexible. I'm using **standalone components** because, just like in a good workout, every part should be able to stand on its own!

## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Standalone Components**: 
   - No clutter, no fuss. Each component is standalone, making the app lightweight and easy to manage. Think of it as a fitness routine‚Äîtargeted, efficient, and without unnecessary repetitions.

2. **New Angular Syntax**: 
   - We‚Äôve embraced the shiny new `@if`, `@else`, and `@for` directives. Just like in the gym, we like our code to be as clean and straightforward as possible.

3. **PrimeNG for UI**:
   - We used **PrimeNG** to give the app that polished, modern look. Why should the UI suffer while you‚Äôre working out? Forms, tables, dialogs - it‚Äôs all here and it looks great (at least in my opinion).

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Every input field comes with built-in validation, so users are *encouraged* (read: forced) to enter the right data. No invalid data sneaking past these forms!

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Whether you're on your phone at the gym or your laptop at home, the app works seamlessly across devices.

6. **Browse Fitness Programs**:
   - Users can explore fitness programs by categories like cardio, strength, or flexibility. Pagination is in place, so you won‚Äôt have to scroll endlessly through all the options - just like how you pace yourself in a workout.

7. **Track Your Progress**:
   - Log your workouts, track your results, and watch your progress on nice, motivating charts. Because who doesn‚Äôt love seeing their hard work in visual form?

8. **Daily Exercise Suggestions**:
   - Need some workout inspiration? The app fetches daily exercise ideas from an external API, giving you fresh new exercises to keep things interesting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Angular 17**: Latest version, standalone components, the works.
- **PrimeNG**: For a user interface that‚Äôs modern and easy on the eyes.
- **Reactive Forms**: With validation to make sure everything you enter is on point.

I hope you enjoy using (or exploring) the app. Whether you‚Äôre here to check out some clean Angular code or to actually stay fit, I got you covered!
Oh and... don't be too harsh as it's my first ever written Angular project!
